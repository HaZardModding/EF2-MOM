DESCRIPTION
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
This is a playable Tech Demo map, to demonstrate
my new modification called MOM (Multi Options Menu).

The distinctive feature of this is that it enables the
Player to use a specific Menu to choose between multiple
options, his selection can be detected by the script and
will perform the predefined action in a function.

This is similar to the stock singleplayer Menus, but it
works in multiplayer any time, without cheats enabled.

16 Options per Menu are provided from which the player can choose.
This map provides the following features:
- A two way Transporter with 4 available different coordinates
- A Replicator, allowing you to pick up and use the items
- 4 new interactivity indicator Symbols
- Gives a weapon to the player on spawn
- A Lift, with 9 levels to go
- A controllable Fontaine
- A Code access Panel
- A destructible Lamp
- 5 different Menus


WARNING
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Please note that 16 options is as far as it will go safely
without disrupting the game its functionality or other
modifications for Elite Force II.

If you intend to use altered contents of this in your release,
please make sure that you do rename the files and menu names
(inside the *.urc files) to avoid compatibility issues.

If you are unsure how to manage this or when ever there are
questions,  please feel free to contact us.


NOTE
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Absolutely Everything is commented in the scripts,
to help you to get into this whole matter in a appropriate
manner.
This MOM is pretty complex if you look at it for the
first time, but take your time and get familiar with
the scripts and menus.
You can edit both with a text-editor, I'd suggest
Notepad++ as I use a special highlighter for it,
which makes scripting 50% less difficult for me.
